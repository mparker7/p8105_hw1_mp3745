# Problem 1

``` r
# Load tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
# Create first dataframe
prob1_df <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8, mean = 8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("burrito", "quesadilla", "tacos", "burrito", "burrito", "tacos", "tacos", "tacos"))
)

# See if mean can be calculated for norm_samp in prob1_df
mean(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 8.561897

``` r
# See if mean can be calculated for norm_samp_pos in prob1_df
mean(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
# See if mean can be calculated for vec_char in prob1_df
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# See if mean can be calculated for vec_factor in prob1_df
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean could be calculated for norm\_samp and norm\_samp\_pos, but not
vec\_char or vec\_factor in prob1\_df.

``` r
# Apply as.numeric to norm_samp_pos from prob1_df
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos))

# Apply as.numeric to vec_char from prob1_df
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))

# Apply as.numeric to vec_factor from prob1_df
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))
```

In the logical vector, all the “TRUE”s were converted into 1’s. In both
the character and factor vector, everything was converted to “NA”. This
explains how we were able to calculate a mean for the logical vector,
but not the character or factor
vector.

``` r
# Convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos)) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1]  9.187469  8.933997  8.528551  7.908096  9.215133  7.021974 10.222140
    ## [8]  7.477816

``` r
# convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
factor(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos)) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(factor(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos)),
    ## pull(prob1_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
# convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the 
# random sample by the result
as.numeric(factor(pull(prob1_df, norm_samp_pos))) * pull(prob1_df, norm_samp)
```

    ## [1]  9.187469  8.933997  8.528551  7.908096  9.215133  7.021974 10.222140

# Problem 2

``` r
# Create the dataframe
prob2_df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_log = x + y > 1,
  vec_num = as.numeric(vec_log),
  vec_fac = factor(vec_log)
)
```

The above dataframe (prob2\_df) has 500 rows and 5 columns. The mean of
x is 0.0427266. The median of x is 0.0473654. The standard deviation of
x is 0.9743441. In addition, the proportion of cases in which x + y \> 1
is 0.228.

``` r
# Scatterplot of y vs x by vec_log from prob2_df
scat_plot_log <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_log)) +
  geom_point()

# Scatterplot of y vs x by vec_num from prob2_df
scat_plot_num <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_num)) +
  geom_point()

# The color scale in the above plot is a sliding scale from blue (vec_num = 1) to black (vec_num = 0), 
# but there are only two distinct colors because vec_num only has two values (0 and 1).

# Scatterplot of y vs x by vec_fac from prob2_df
scat_plot_fac <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_fac)) +
  geom_point()

# The color scale in the above plot is the same as when coloring by the logical vector. The factor 
# vector only has two values (True or False).

# Export the first scatterplot
ggsave("scatter_plot_log.png", plot = scat_plot_log)
```
